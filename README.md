# Development

Styles are compiled using Gulp/Sass. You'll need to cd into content/themes/discoverer and run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Now you can edit `/styles/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/styles/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
$ gulp zip
```
